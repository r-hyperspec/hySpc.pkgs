**For developers:** The instructions about how to administer this repo are in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/r-hyperspec/hySpc.pkgs/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md).

**For users:** If you want to install a package, simply use R function `install.packages()` with the additional repository added as shown in this example:

```r
repos <- c("https://r-hyperspec.github.io/hySpc.pkgs/", getOption("repos"))
install.packages("hyperSpec", repos = repos)
```
